## Purpose
There are some website which have copy paste restrictions and this app will allow you
to bypass this system and paste stuff.
\
In order to use this you will first have to paste the thing you want to paste in the paste.txt file.
\
Then you will have to run the program.There is a 5 second buffer which gives you ample amount of time to place the cursor.
\
The program scans through the paste.txt file and will virtually type it out for you.

## Reason
I created this program to bypass a paste restrictions on a coding assignment website which was built by our university.
